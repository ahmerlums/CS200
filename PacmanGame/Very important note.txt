If you are running on terminal , make sure that the window bottom of terminal is resized so that the bottom line of maze is shown (Otherwise the game will never end as that line is included in the condition). And for some reason my code was not running on Code Blocks after I added the vector library for bonus part, so make sure to run it on ssl if the game doesn,t run on a windows compiler.
